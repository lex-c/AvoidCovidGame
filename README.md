## Avoid COVID Game:

### Developer Objective:

> - Educate people on risk factors
>
> - Say something about resources and opportunity disparities and their effects on covid risk

### Game Rules:
#### Welcome to the Avoid Covid game:
##### where survival is a virtue and everyone's a sinner

#### Here are the rules (in case you're still hoping to win ðŸ˜‚):

- You start with 100 Health and Mental Health, and some Food, Meds, and Money  

-  If you stay home you won't run into any risks, but your Mental Health will go down
-  Your Food and Meds are constantly going down and you need to go to the store and spend Money to refill them
-  You can make more Money by going to the work place; but beware, it costs you Health and Mental Health...
-  If your Food runs out, your Health starts going down fast
-  You can replenish your Mental Health by going to the park and your Health by staying home if your meds are mostly full
-  If your Health or Mental Health reach zero you lose...
  
#### Now the fun part: random risks outside the home

- On the street, people with varying risk to you will randomly show up; if they happen to be near you, you'll see them:

  - You'll see a pop up describing the person and a set of choices:
  
  - You can run away: you don't get any virus exposure, but you have to walk around them now... and your caution goes down, so they'll come at you just a little more frequently now...
  - You can keep on going: you'll risk getting some virus exposure depending on what the risk person decides to do... good luck
- Different acts make different amounts of virus: (e.g. a cough makes much more virus than a yell); and the conditions matter: were they covering their mouth?, was the wind blowing?, etc.
- You can only take a certain amount of exposure within a small amount of time: if you get a little exposure, wait a long time, and then another little, you won't catch it; but if you get a whole lot at once, or several little amounts one after the other, you catch it
- How much exposure you can take depends on your health and mental health (if you're very sick or stressed, it's easier for you to catch it)
- You can only run away from one person; if there are two people near you, you must choose which one to expose yourself to
- Inside environments (STORES) have different frequency of pop ups and the risks are bigger (an inside cough doesn't get blown away by the wind), so be careful inside! Someone who wouldn't pose a risk outside CAN inside
- Stay in stores only as long as necessary!
- Last note: if you're home and your Mental Health is not low, your caution will SLOWLY replenish

#### That's all! Go!!! Have fun! Live! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
##### Oh, I almost forgot: if you make it to 24H you win, not that I have any hope you'll get there...


### User Stories: 
 * I want to be able to see the status of my gamerep's health, food, etc AND to have it be noticeable when it goes down or up
  
 * I want to get feedback when I make a choice telling me what the result of that was and what my status is now and maybe hint to me what further options I have after that
 * I want to be able to tell how my person is moving on the outside board, not too fast but also not so slow that it's painful to control
 * I don't want to make any game choices by mistake; i.e. leave the store or go in by pressing accidentally
 * I want to know how well I'm doing so I can adjust my choices: maybe include reminders if things are getting bad and color code stats display
